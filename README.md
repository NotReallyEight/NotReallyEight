## About Me

Hi, I'm Antonio Wang — I write code by day and chase light with a camera by... also day. I'm 19 and obsessed with building things that work and look good. When I'm not coding, I'm probably out framing strangers like characters in a story — freezing time at 1/160th of a second, one shot at a time.
